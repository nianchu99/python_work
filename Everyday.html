<h2>2020.07.02</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In the morning, I just played the plane, maybe I shouldn't do this</li>
    <li>In the afternoon, I had a long and nice lunch break, and I woke at 5 o'clock. Sleep is for health, for this, I think I'm right </li>
    <li>In the evening, after had a dinner, I reviewed the knowledge of Python Class and some other python knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2020.07.03</h2>
Today is little better than yesterday
<ul>
    <li>In the morning, I did the same thing as yesterday. I know it's not a good behavior, maybe tomorrow I will lose it.I hope so.</li>
    <li>In the afternoon, I eventually start the django project successfully, then I have a short break</li>
    <li>After a while since I woke, I had a dinner with my parents. They come to home from work, may be they are going to have their leaves</li>
    <li>In the evening, I went on learning about python and django, and also something about HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>I had game time too, may be totally 3 hours.</li>
    <li>Oh! Before going to sleep, I will have some English exercise and memorize some Grade-Six words in order that
        I can get a grade over 600 points in next English Grade-Six Exam two months later.</li>
</ul>
